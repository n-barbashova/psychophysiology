    "## Heart Rate Processing and Baseline Correction \n",
    "Script by Nadu Barbashova \n",
    "\n",
    "This Script is also on Github in my Psychophysiology Folder: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/n-barbashova/psychophysiology/tree/master/HeartRate \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About this script: \n",
    "My Experiment: \n",
    "Participants wait 60 seconds for stimuli (shocks or stimulations). In this time they watch a 60 second coundown. For 30 of these seconds they complete the flanker task and for the other 30 seconds they just watch the countdown. The order depends on which countdown it is. There are 36 countdowns, divided into 9 runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to see how the heartrate is affected by the condition (is this a threat countdown (leading to shock) or a no-threat countdown (leading to stim)). I want to also see how heart rate is affected when it's the flanker task epoch vs the countdown epoch. This labels all the relevant info.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also downsamples one additional time (by a factor of 10). This means that at the end of processing the sampling rate is 10hz. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What this script does:\n",
    "* Adds Event Codes \n",
    "* Processes HR Data \n",
    "* Baseline Corrects \n",
    "\n",
    "This script takes the pre-processed ECG data and further processes it using functions from Neurokit. It cleans the heart rate, finds event codes and using the event codes, labels which condition this is (shock or stim), which interval it is (flanker or countdown). In addition to processing the heart rate it also does one second heart rate baseline correction, comparing the heart rate in the given interval to the heart rate in the one second before the countdown began. \n",
    "\n",
    "It adds event code info based on the number in the \"EVENT\" col, and it adds an intervalNum col to keep track of which countdown per run this is (each run has 4 countdowns). \n",
    " \n",
    "### Input required: \n",
    "Timings files (txt files) with info on the subject and run number in the filename. \n",
    "Example: 110_run9.txt (This is for subject 100, run 9) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Output from this script: \n",
    "The first main block/cell of this script will output a new processed file for each input file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second main block of this script will combine all subjects and runs together and add a column for countdown number (1-36). \n",
    "\n",
