Flanker: 
Flanker stim appear = channel 7 


To do: 
- I removed the "start" event - so now add it back 
-         index = data['start'].tolist().index('start') + 40
- maybe 39 instead? 
- make sure it's kept in some form 
- flanker often appears at the end of every countdown - 
- probably psychopy error  the flanker loop resests/ restart  at the end 
- index - if one of the "start" codes appears within 5 seconds of countdown end, 
# just set those channels to 0 


# don't need flanker end
